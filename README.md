all the files are upload in the directory libft and including the make file that this chase is a litte bit differents than the other students couse I had try with my own test file every funtion but in the final upload I decide to delete it for not make any issues with molinette rules, but i never delete the rules to use it in my makefile.

all mandatory funtions are done for the ft_printf and it work perfecly with all the tests like francinette strict, and all molinettes rules are followed.
